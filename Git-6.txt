Git Reset
=================
This is the process of toggling between multiple commits
This is done in 3 ways
1 Hard reset
2 Soft reset
3 Mixed Reset

Hard Reset
==================
Here the  HEAD points to an older commit and we can see the data
as it was present at the time of that commit

1 Create file file1 and stroe the blow data
  one

2 Send this file into stagging area and local repository
  git add .
  git commit -m "a"

3 Modify the same file file1 and store some more data
  one
  two

4 Send this file into stagging area and local repository
  git add .
  git commit -m "b"

5 Modify the same file one morw time
  one
  two
  three

6 Send this file into stagging area and local repository
  git add .
  git commit -m "c"

7 Check the commit history
  git log --oneline

8 To hard reset from c to b commit
  git reset --hard b_commitid

9 We will see that HEAD points to b commit and we see the data as it was
  at the time of b commit

===============================================================================
Soft Reset
==============
This will also make the head point to an older commit but the status
of git will will show as it was present just before the commit took place
ie the files will be shown in the stagging area and HEAD will be pointing to
an older commit

git reset --soft b_commitid


Mixed Reset
==================
This will also make the head point to an older commit but the status
of git will will show as it was present 2 steps before the commit took place
ie the files will be shown as present in the untracked modfied section

git reset --mixed b_commitid



=======================================================
Git amend
==============
Modifying an existing commit and adding/deleting files from a commit
is called as git amend

When we make minor modificatiosn to the code and we dont want to
create a commit for these minor modificatios we can uses git amend

1 Create few commits
  touch file1
  git add .
  git commit -m "a"
  touch file2
  git add .
  git commimt -m "b"

2 Check the commit history
  git log --oneline

3 Create some more files and send into stagging area
  touch file3
  git add .

4 Instead of creating a new commit add them to the current "b" commit
  git commit --amend -m "b"

5 Check the commit history
  git log --oneline
